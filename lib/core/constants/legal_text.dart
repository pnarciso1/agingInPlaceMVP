Privacy

Your submission of personal information is governed by our Privacy Policy. To view our Privacy Policy, go to the Privacy Policy link provided on our site. Health and behavior related data may be sensitive; you consent to the collection and processing of such data as described in the Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws. We may share data with affiliates, service providers, or partners as necessary to provide the Services, subject to appropriate safeguards and legal bases. For health data, additional protections may apply under HIPAA (in the U.S.) or other local laws; we will handle such data in accordance with applicable law.

Data Use

All content, applications, tools, devices, products, and services provided by ALBERTai are intended to support decision making related to aging in place. Any information you provide through the Services, including health data, may be used to provide and improve the Services, perform analytics, and comply with legal obligations. You grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to process and use such information for these purposes, subject to the Privacy Policy and applicable law. We may share aggregated, de-identified, or pseudonymized data for research and product improvement purposes, provided such data cannot reasonably identify you or any individual.

Disclaimers

The Services are provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, or non-infringement. We do not warrant that the Aging-In-Place Score or any results will be accurate, complete, reliable, timely, or secure. You acknowledge that data inputs may affect outputs, and we do not guarantee outcomes based on those outputs. Nothing herein constitutes medical advice or a diagnosis, and you should consult a licensed medical professional for medical concerns.

Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Unity Global Care and its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, interns, licensors, and service providers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Services, including but not limited to lost profits, lost revenue, loss of data, or other economic losses, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Our total liability for direct damages for any claim arising out of these Terms or the Services shall not exceed the amount paid by you, if any, for the specific Service giving rise to the claim within the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, to the extent permitted by law. The foregoing limitations and exclusions apply to all causes of action arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise.

Additional Provisions Governing Law and Disputes:

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services shall be resolved through informal negotiations, followed by binding arbitration in accordance with AAA rules, in a mutually agreed venue (or as determined by the arbitrator). The arbitrator shall apply Delaware law. Class action waivers apply to the fullest extent permitted by law. Privacy rights and obligations under applicable privacy laws remain unaffected.

Authorized Parties

For partners, employees, investors, or board members with access to confidential information or systems, access is limited to the minimum necessary and must be safeguarded. Compliance with internal policies, confidentiality agreements, privacy laws, and data protection requirements is mandatory. Breaches must be reported promptly to Unity Global Care’s designated contact. Access may be terminated at any time for any reason.

Modifications and Notices

We may modify or discontinue the Services, or any part or content thereof, at any time without notice. We will provide notice of material changes where feasible. Prices for products or services may change; changes may occur with or without notice as permitted by applicable law. Electronic communications (email) are acceptable for notices and policy updates.

Miscellaneous

If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full effect. No waiver of any term shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of any other term. These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any referenced policies, constitute the entire agreement between you and Unity Global Care regarding the Services and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings. You may not assign your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.
